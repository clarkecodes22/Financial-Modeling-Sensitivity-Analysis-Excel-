## 📊 Project

### **The Body Shop Financial Forecast Model**  
Developed a multi-year financial model to evaluate The Body Shop’s sales, COGS, and operating metrics. The model incorporates key inputs such as sales growth and COGS-to-sales ratios to generate projections. A sensitivity analysis table tests outcomes based on varying these assumptions, helping stakeholders visualize the financial implications of strategic decisions.

#### Key Components:
- **Historical Data & Forecasting**: Analyzed financial performance over 2002–2004 and extended projections into 2024.
- **Ratio Analysis**: Evaluated liquidity and debt management using ratios like Current, Quick, and Cash Ratios.
- **Scenario Testing**: Created a sensitivity analysis table to evaluate the effects of different sales growth and cost structures on profitability.
